About OpenCV GPU demos pack
---------------------------

All the demos can be run without any command line arguments.

All the demos will print help if you run them with the "--help" parameter.

If a demo supports both GPU and CPU modes you can toggle between them using the SPACE key. But note that some of the demos don't have CPU analogues, so they support GPU mode only.

Some demos use video files by default. If you don't see a reasonable output then install codecs pack from the "codecs\" folder and re-run the demos. When installing you may just confirm all what the installer suggests you.
